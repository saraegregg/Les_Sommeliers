## Project Overview: Wine Quality Prediction
The goal of this project is to predict quality of wine by utilizing a dataset highlighting over 130,000 individual wine entries with factors such as region, province, price, points (quality), description, variety, and designation. The project will utilize a regression machine learning approach to predict points (indicating wine quality from 80-100) by incorporating many of the factors included above. The project will also build a dashboard and/or interactive map to illustrate wine quality and price by region and province. it may also highlight top winery's by location. The dashboard could be beneficial for restaurant owners seeking to build a comprehensive and well-rounded wine offering and the map could be helpful for travel agents and/or individual consumers seeking high quality wine on the road.

Additional visualizatoins that may be beneficial for this project include: 
- Heatmap of wine volumes by region or country
- Interactive map with markers showing average wine price and points and winery with highest quality wine
- Price and points by variety and designation
- Most common variety by volume
- Interactive dashboard in which the user can filter by country or region and see top wineries, top wines, and price
