38975,Spain,"Vegetal and metallic on the nose, this Verdejo fails to improve as it goes along. It's dilute in feel, with celery and grassy flavors. It finishes bitter and flabby.",,80,20,Central Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Gran Castillo Royal 2012 Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla),Verdejo,Gran Castillo Royal
38976,Argentina,"The wine shows a maderized color and aromas of oxidized stone fruits and rubber. This fast-fading rosÃ© feels flat, with mushy flavors of peach, melon and mushroom.

39284,Argentina,"Murky, stewy, soupy aromas deliver little to no freshness or fruit, while the palate is tannic and tastes bitter, mildly weedy and minty. Seems roasted and devoid of quality.

39285,Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled.

39958,Chile,"Rather dilute, it shows slight black-cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors. The overall impression is really little more than alcohol and faint body. Finishes very dry, with innocuous tannins.",Reserve,80,10,Maule Valley,,,,,Alfasi 1998 Reserve Merlot (Maule Valley),Merlot,Alfasi
39959,US,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter.
